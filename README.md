# federalist
*an open-source digital curator of the Federalist Papers*

### Current status

*federalist* is in the middle of a rebase to get the code cleaned up and into
an open-source friendly format. Current working branch is: */feature/initial_rebase*

After the initial rebase, this repo will follow the [git
flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)
workflow.

## Description

*federalist* started as a quick Fourth of July project, made in my spare time.
As of this update, it is still that hacky code base. It allows a user to
download the public domain text of *The Federalist Papers* by John Jay,
Alexander Hamilton and James Madison. 

The user may then enter a comma-separated list of papers and *federalist*
writes them to a separate .html file, complete with Zen Habits css styling for
ease of readibility.
